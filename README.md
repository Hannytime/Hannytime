## Hi, I'm Ilona and I'm a technical writer based in Wrocław!

I'm learning how to use git to create documentation and gather most important information. I work in an IT company that makes ERP software, but I have experience also as a translator and proofreader of English.

Currently, I'm working on a project I created to keep track of subtitles that I translated into Polish as part of an international fan project (Taskmaster Worldwide Inc.). The subtitles are for a brilliant British show called Taskmaster, which I wholeheartedly recommend.

**Feel free to look around and reach out!**
